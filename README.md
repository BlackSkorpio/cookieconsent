# Cookie Consent for Koken CMS
A Koken plugin to inform your users that you are using cookies

## What is Cookie Consent? 
Cookie Consent is a lightweight JavaScript plugin for alerting users about the use of cookies on your website.

It is designed to help you comply with the hideous EU Cookie Law and not make you want to kill yourself in the process. So we made it fast, free, and relatively painless.
